    <h1 class="project-title">The Regulatory Dilemma: <i>How Rules Shape Innovation</i></h1>
</section>

    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Introduction & Aim</h2>
        <p>Innovation drives economic growth, societal progress, and technological advancement. However, the regulatory environment—designed to safeguard public welfare—often acts as both a gateway and a gatekeeper to innovation. This balance, where regulation fosters and restricts development, is the essence of the "Regulatory Dilemma." This project explores how rules shape innovation across countries, industries, and periods. By examining trends, relationships, and case studies, I aim to determine whether regulations facilitate or impede innovation, and how policymakers can balance oversight with progress.</p>
        <p>Through data visualizations, this project tells a compelling story about the interplay between regulation and innovation, offering insights into the future of regulatory policies and their potential effects on innovation.</p>

        <h2>Trends in Innovation and Regulation</h2>
        <p>We begin by exploring trends in patent applications and federal regulatory growth.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>As the graph demonstrates, both regulation (through pages) and innovation (through patents) have grown, suggesting a relationship where regulation evolves alongside technological progress.</p>
        <p>I obtained the data as a csv download from WIPO, and George Washington University.</p>

        <h2>The Relationship Between Regulatory Efficiency and Innovation</h2>
        <p>This chapter examines how regulatory efficiency impacts R&D expenditure and the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business score.</p>

    <div>
        <p>The clear trend in the scatter plot reveals that countries with streamlined regulatory processes tend to invest more in R&D.</p>
        <p>This data was downloaded from the world bank, I then had to convert it to long form using Google Colabs.</p>

        <h2>Quantitative Measurements for Regulation and Innovation: <i>The Fraser Institutes 'Economics Freedom Score' against G20 Total Patent Filings</i></h2>
        <p>We now compare the Fraser Institute's 'Economic Freedom Score' with G20 patent filings over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
        
        <figure class="chart" id="Location3"></figure>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We can see a tremendous difference in the rate of growth of patent applications between the nation with the highest Freedom Score (United States of America), and the lowest (Argentina).</p>
        <p>The Economic Freedom Data is from the Fraser Institute, and the patent data is from WIPO. Both had to be cleaned and formatted to long form using Colabs. I also used python to filter the results down to only the G20 countries.</p>

        <h2>Case Study: <i>The European Union and The United States</i></h2>
        <p>This chapter compares the patent landscapes of the European Union and the United States, bodies with vastly different regulatory structures.</p>

    <div id="chartGrid">
        <figure class="chart" id="Location4"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The data reveals that the US has experienced significantly more growth in patent application than the EU making it clear that the reduced regulatory presence in the US has promoted far greater innovation than what has been seen in the EU.</p>
        <p>I sourced the data from WIPO, then cleaned the data and converted the file to long form using Google Colabs. I then used python to filter the results to only the US, and EU patent offices.</p>

        <h2>A Global Scale: <i>The Geographical Trends in Efficient Regulation</i></h2>
        <p>Here we view the World Bank's 'Ease of Doing Business' data on a map.</p>

    <div id="chartGrid">
        <figure class="chart" id="Location5"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The map shows that nations with efficient regulatory frameworks are often more developed nations, indicating that poorer nations may have restricted growth due to an inability to construct efficient regulatory frameworks.</p>
        <p>I sourced this data from the World Bank, using python to convert to long form and check that all country names match those required from my json map.</p>

        <p>This data is pulled from a live API using the ONS’s time series data. To create the URL’s for the API’s, I used loops in Colabs. I then concatenated the graphs together on Vega-lite.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Policy Recommendations</h2>
        <p>This project has shown that the balance between regulation and innovation is delicate. Excessive regulation can limit growth, but efficient, well-targeted rules can foster an environment where innovation, and growth thereof, thrives. The contrast between countries with high economic freedom and those burdened by excessive regulations has served to highlight the importance of quality over quantity in regulatory oversight.</p>
        <p>To boost innovation, policymakers should emphasize regulatory efficiency—focusing on clarity, and ease of doing business. By streamlining processes and encouraging dialogue between innovators and regulators, regulation can serve to guide growth, rather than obstruct it. The key is not to blindly regulate, but to regulate effectively against the backdrop of continued growth.</p>

        <h2>Project Challenges</h2>
        <p>The primary issue I faced with the project was data gathering and formatting. In many cases, such as from WIPO and the Fraser Institute, the downloadable data was not formatted appropriately for importing into Vega-Lite. This meant I often had to remove unnecessary columns and rows from the data, then converting the data from wide to long form using Google Colabs. Another challenge I faced was when trying to filter by country name. This was an issue as many datasets use different formats to name the same country, i.e. 'United States', 'United States of America'.</p>
